# SimplySignup

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.


I chose angular because of the speed. This is a single page application that loads fast and uses very little browser resources.

It also uses angular material for styling since Chrome runs on more than 60% of devices and supports angular material well


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
